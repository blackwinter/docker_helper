= docker_helper - Helper methods to interact with Docker

== VERSION

This documentation refers to docker_helper version 0.0.0.


== DESCRIPTION

Control the Docker[https://docker.com] command-line client from Ruby. Contrary
to {docker-api}[https://rubygems.org/gems/docker-api], this library only calls
the Docker client as an external process and thus doesn't need to run with
elevated privileges as a whole.

Basic usage:

  # Initialize proxy object or include in your own class
  docker = DockerHelper.proxy

  class MyClass; include DockerHelper; end
  docker = MyClass.new

  # Call central helper with any Docker action and arguments
  docker.docker('inspect', 'my-container')
  docker.docker(:images).lines.drop(1)

  # Call predefined helper methods (short form only for proxy object)
  docker.docker_version
  docker.version

  docker.docker_build(path, name)
  docker.build(path, name)

See DockerHelper for more information.
